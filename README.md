### Project Description

Factify is a fake news classifier app that I worked on along with my team for my final year project. This app detects fake news from the dataset, segregates it from the real news, and finally, displays the real news on the main screen of the app. The fake news classifier was built using the convolutional neural network algorithm. This app also consisted of a chatbot which was built for user interaction purposes. 

NOTE: Due to some issues with my laptop, I lost files of my main app so in this repository I have uploaded only the classifier code.

#### Technical Stack

* Fake News Classifier
    * Python
    * Google Colaboratory 
    * Flask (for hosting on the server)
       
* Chatbot
    * Dialogflow 
     
* App
    * Java 
    * Android Studio 


#### Getting Started

Prerequisites for running the CNN algorithm

* Get the latest release of Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
* Download the editor of your choice. Some of the editors you can use are PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, and Google Colab. 
* Install all the required libraries before running the code. 

NOTE: If you are using Google Colab, you will not need to install libraries separately. 

#### Contributing

This project is complete and therefore, not open for contribution to the code. But any suggestions regarding the implementation are **highly appreciated**.
