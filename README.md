## ABOUT THE PROJECT

Factify is a fake news classifier app that I worked on along with my team for my final year project. This app detects fake news from the dataset, segregates it from the real news, and finally, displays the real news on the main screen of the app. The fake news classifier was built using the convolutional neural network algorithm. This app also consisted of a chatbot which was built for user interaction purposes. 

NOTE: Due to some issues with my laptop, I lost files of my main app so in this repository I have uploaded only the classifier code.
